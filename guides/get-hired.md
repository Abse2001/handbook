# Getting Hired at tscircuit

tscircuit is funded and we're always looking for sharp engineers. Here are things
that make someone a great fit for tscircuit (you should have 1-2 of these traits):

- [ ] Familiar with web development and Typescript
- [ ] Familiar with game development or graphics programming
- [ ] Familiar with basic electronics
- [ ] Contributor to tscircuit

You don't have to have all of these, but they will make you stand out.

In addition to the characteristics above, we have certain requirements as a U.S.
company and to keep efficiency high:

- Be based in a [country we support via Deel](https://help.letsdeel.com/hc/en-gb/articles/4407737728273-Where-Is-Deel-Available).
  There are NO EXCEPTIONS to this, we are a small company with no HR team and have no capacity to deal with special requirements.
- Be available for full-time work (if you're working other jobs at the same time, you are probably not committed enough, just work
  bounties or take the open-source sponsorship)
- Be generally available from 8am to 10am pacific time daily. We rarely have meetings, but it's expected that meetings scheduled at these
  times are acceptable

## Protips

- If you have open-source contributions and/or contributions to tscircuit, you are much more
  likely to be hired
- Don't make excuses about your Github. We get that not all companies are on Github or whatever.
  If you don't have green grass or visible code we're just going to assume you can't program because
  it's one of the few non-noisy signals we have. If you don't have stuff on your Github contribute
  to tscircuit to prove you can code.

## What do we pay?

We generally pay between $2k-$6k/mo (USD) for early-career engineers outside the US. If you're a legend and check
lots of boxes above, you'll be paid more, but keep in mind we're an early stage startup with limited funding.
When we raise future rounds we'll get closer to market parity.

Every country has differnet taxes, rules and risk. Your location is a factor in how the salary is
determined, but we care mostly about your development speed/skills.

## Ready to Apply?

Shoot an email to apply@tscircuit.com with your Github and resume. Don't worry about a cover letter,
your email can literally be:

```

We usually respond within a month to applications.
